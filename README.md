# Intelligent Transportation Systems in Ghana: Youth Perspectives and Implications for Urban Mobility

This repository contains the data and analytical pipeline for the paper "**Intelligent Transportation Systems in Ghana: Youth Perspectives and Implications for Urban Mobility**". The study evaluates the awareness, attitudes, and adoption readiness of Ghanaian youth toward Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) using a multi-method analytical approach

## Paper Overview

The paper investigates the "awareness-attitude gap" in the adoption of ITS within the context of rapid urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa. Key contributions include:

* **Public Acceptance Evaluation**: Assessment of awareness and adoption readiness among 480 technology-savvy Ghanaian youth.
* **Methodological Pipeline**: Integration of descriptive and bivariate statistics, Cramér's V, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), and unsupervised clustering.
* **Predictor Identification**: Finding that positive attitude is the strongest predictor of behavioral intention to adopt ITS, mediating the influence of general technology exposure.
* **Policy Roadmap**: Evidence-based recommendations for institutional strengthening and infrastructure upgrades to support sustainable ITS integration in developing urban contexts.

## Datasets Used

The study utilizes a primary dataset collected through a cross-sectional survey to validate findings on user perceptions and readiness:

* **Ghana ITS Youth Perception Dataset**:
    * **Source**: Structured online survey administered to university students in southern, middle, and northern Ghana.
    * **Data URL**: [Replace this with your GitHub file link, e.g., https://github.com/yourname/repo/blob/main/data.csv]
    * **Description**: This dataset contains 480 valid responses capturing socio-demographic information, digital technology usage patterns, and Likert-scale ratings for ITS awareness, perceived benefits, and adoption willingness.
    * **Key Variables**: Includes familiarity levels with infrastructure-based vs. consumer-facing ITS, perceived benefits (e.g., smart signals, enforcement cameras), and behavioral intention to use these technologies.
