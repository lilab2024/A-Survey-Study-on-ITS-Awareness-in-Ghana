# Intelligent Transportation Systems in Ghana: Youth Perspectives and Implications for Urban Mobility

[cite_start]This repository contains the data and analytical pipeline for the paper "**Intelligent Transportation Systems in Ghana: Youth Perspectives and Implications for Urban Mobility**" (published in *IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine*, 2025)[cite: 2, 3, 14]. [cite_start]The study evaluates the awareness, attitudes, and adoption readiness of Ghanaian youth toward Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) using a multi-method analytical approach[cite: 8, 9].

## Paper Overview

[cite_start]The paper investigates the "awareness-attitude gap" in the adoption of ITS within the context of rapid urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa[cite: 7, 10]. Key contributions include:

* [cite_start]**Public Acceptance Evaluation**: Assessment of awareness and adoption readiness among 480 technology-savvy Ghanaian youth[cite: 8, 231, 232].
* [cite_start]**Methodological Pipeline**: Integration of descriptive and bivariate statistics, Cramér's V, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), and unsupervised clustering[cite: 9, 10].
* [cite_start]**Predictor Identification**: Finding that positive attitude is the strongest predictor of behavioral intention to adopt ITS, mediating the influence of general technology exposure[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Policy Roadmap**: Evidence-based recommendations for institutional strengthening and infrastructure upgrades to support sustainable ITS integration in developing urban contexts[cite: 14, 701].

## Datasets Used

[cite_start]The study utilizes a primary dataset collected through a cross-sectional survey to validate findings on user perceptions and readiness[cite: 8, 199]:

* **Ghana ITS Youth Perception Dataset**:
    * [cite_start]**Source**: Structured online survey administered to university students in southern, middle, and northern Ghana[cite: 189, 215, 219].
    * **Data URL**: [Replace this with your GitHub file link, e.g., https://github.com/yourname/repo/blob/main/data.csv]
    * [cite_start]**Description**: This dataset contains 480 valid responses capturing socio-demographic information, digital technology usage patterns, and Likert-scale ratings for ITS awareness, perceived benefits, and adoption willingness[cite: 172, 232, 255].
    * [cite_start]**Key Variables**: Includes familiarity levels with infrastructure-based vs. consumer-facing ITS, perceived benefits (e.g., smart signals, enforcement cameras), and behavioral intention to use these technologies[cite: 204, 254, 342].
